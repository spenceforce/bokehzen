# BokehZen

BokehZen aims to make [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) more user-friendly by simplifying the developer experience. By abstracting away callbacks, BokehZen provides an intuitive API for binding widgets to plots, making it easier to build interactive visualizations without the complexity.

## Features

- **Declarative API:** A high-level approach to defining interactivity without writing low-level event handlers.
- **Minimal Boilerplate:** Reduce the need for manual callback definitions.
- **Flexible Integration:** Works with existing Bokeh projects and layouts.

## Alternatives

There are several interactive visualization libraries out there. A few of the big ones are:

- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org/) - BokehZen is heavily inspired by the interactive API of hvPlot and I highly recommend it as an alternative.
- [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org/) - For the purists out there.
- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) - A great data exploration library.
- [Plotly](https://plotly.com/) - An alternative to Bokeh.
